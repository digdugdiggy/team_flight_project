Drone Control is a multi-faceted piece of software,
written in Java and Javascript, for Senior Project at University of Houston Clear Lake.

It is composed of two main modules:  

1. A 3D First-Person-View Quadcopter Flight Simulator  
  * Procedurally generated, maze-like winding corridor levels.  
  * Simplified 3D flight model based on vector math.
  * XBOX 360 controller support.
  
2. A Hardware Controller for the [Parrot AR 2.0](http://ardrone2.parrot.com/) Quadcopter
  * Watch live onboard camera footage.
  * Multiple input modes and safety features.
